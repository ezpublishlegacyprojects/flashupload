2. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using FlashUpload extension:

   o  eZ publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ publish version 3.9 or higher.

   o  PHP version:

      Make sure you have PHP 4.4 or higher.


Getting eZ publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/download/all_releases/ez_publish_3_stable_releases

NOTE: You will require eZ publish 3.9 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/installation


Installing FlashUpload extension
====================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on the file you 
   downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf flashupload-extension-1.0.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf flashupload-extension-1.0.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip flashupload-extension-1.0.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the 
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings/override. If this file does not exist; create it. Locate
   (or add) the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=flashupload
   
   If you want to use the Website Interface extension feature, this line must be above the
   ezwebin line:
   
   ActiveExtensions[]=flashupload
   ActiveExtensions[]=ezwebin

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=flashupload
4. Exclude swfuploadr5.swf from RewriteRule in .htaccess eg:

	  RewriteRule ^(.*)swfuploadr5\.swf [L]
	  
    or
	
      RewriteRule !\.(gif|ico|jpe?g|png|css|js)|swfuploadr5\.swf$ index.php
	  
5. Check this has worked by browsing to:

      /extension/flashupload/design/standard/flash/swfuploadr5.swf
	  
6. To use the toolbar: add flashupload tool to a toolbar in admin->design->toolbars

7. There's a bug in the Mac Flash player which appends port 80 to the upload url. This means
   if you have different session ids for each siteaccess and use something other than url
   matching, eZ will use the default siteaccess session id. To get around this you need to
   explicity send port 80 requests to the relevant siteaccess. eg for Host Matching:
   
     HostMatchMapItems[]=admin.domain.com:80;admin
	 
8. Clear cache!



Upgrading

Just replace the files and clear the cache
