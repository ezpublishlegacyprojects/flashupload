FlashUpload extension 1.0 FAQ

1. FlashUpload is not activated in eZ publish
=================================================

You will need to check if the extension is properly activated in site.ini.
Edit `settings/override/site.ini.append' or `settings/override/site.ini.append.php'
and find the `ExtensionSettings' group. Under it you should have an entry
that says:

ActiveExtensions[]=flashupload

Make sure there are no spaces before or after the name.

You should also consider checking the debug output of eZ publish to see what is
going wrong.
